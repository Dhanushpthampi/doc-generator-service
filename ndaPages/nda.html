    <h1>Non-Disclosure Agreement</h1>

    <p>This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of <strong>{{ effective_date }}</strong> (the
        "Effective Date"), by and between:</p>

    <p><strong>Disclosing Party:</strong> {{ client_name }} ("Disclosing Party")</p>
    <p><strong>Receiving Party:</strong> {{ counterparty_name }} ("Receiving Party")</p>

    <p>WHEREAS, the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party (collectively, the "Parties") desire to establish a
        confidential relationship for the purpose of preventing the unauthorized use and disclosure of certain
        proprietary and confidential information.</p>

    <p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:</p>

    <h2>1. Definition of Confidential Information</h2>
    <p>For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall include all information or material that has or
        could have commercial value or other utility in the business in which Disclosing Party is engaged. If
        Confidential Information is in written form, the Disclosing Party shall label or stamp the materials with the
        word "Confidential" or some similar warning. If Confidential Information is transmitted orally, the Disclosing
        Party shall promptly provide a writing indicating that such oral communication constituted Confidential
        Information.</p>

    <h2>2. Exclusions from Confidential Information</h2>
    <p>Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement do not extend to information that is: (a) publicly known at
        the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes publicly known through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b)
        discovered or created by the Receiving Party before disclosure by Disclosing Party; (c) learned by the Receiving
        Party through legitimate means other than from the Disclosing Party or Disclosing Party's representatives; or
        (d) is disclosed by Receiving Party with Disclosing Party's prior written approval.</p>

    <h2>3. Obligations of Receiving Party</h2>
    <p>Receiving Party shall hold and maintain the Confidential Information in strictest confidence for the sole and
        exclusive benefit of the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall carefully restrict access to Confidential
        Information to employees, contractors, and third parties as is reasonably required and shall require those
        persons to sign non-disclosure restrictions at least as protective as those in this Agreement. Receiving Party
        shall not, without prior written approval of Disclosing Party, use for Receiving Party's own benefit, publish,
        copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of
        Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information.</p>

    <h2>4. Time Periods</h2>
    <p>The nondisclosure provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and Receiving
        Party's duty to hold Confidential Information in confidence shall remain in effect until the Confidential
        Information no longer qualifies as a trade secret or until Disclosing Party sends Receiving Party written notice
        releasing Receiving Party from this Agreement, whichever occurs first.</p>

    <h2>5. Relationships</h2>
    <p>Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute either party a partner, joint venturer or
        employee of the other party for any purpose.</p>

    <h2>6. Severability</h2>
    <p>If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall
        be interpreted so as best to effect the intent of the parties.</p>

    <h2>7. Integration</h2>
    <p>This Agreement expresses the complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter and
        supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, representations, and understandings. This Agreement may not be
        amended except in a writing signed by both parties.</p>

    <h2>8. Waiver</h2>
    <p>The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This Agreement and the interpretation of its terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
        of the {{ jurisdiction }} and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located
        therein.</p>
